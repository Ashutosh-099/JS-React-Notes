# Hoisting
- Hoisting in JS is a core concept relies on the way how execution context is created.
- As we know, in first phase i.e. Memory allocation phase, all the variables and functions are allocated memory, even before any code is executed.
- All the variables are assigned `undefined` at this instance in local memory.
- Even Arrow functions enact as a variable and get undefined during the memory allocation phase.
- Hoisting is a mechanism in JS where all the variable declarations are moved to the top of the scope before execution, Therefore it is possible to call a function before intializing it.

# Window & this keyword
- `window` object is created by the JS engines of the respective browsers when global execution context is created.
- Whenever an execution context is created, a `this` variable is also created.
- At the global level, `this` points to the global object(`window` object in case of browser).
- Anything that is not inside the function is the `global space`.
- Whenever we create any variable or function in global space, it get attached to global object(`window` object in case of browser)
- So to access variables/functions inside global space, there are several ways:
  1. `console.log(window.a)`
  2. `console.log(a)`
  3. `console.log(this.a) //at the global space level, where this points to the window object`
 
## undefined
`undefined` is a like a placeholder till a variable is not assigned value. `undefined != not defined`. It is special placeholder which reserves memory for each variable in the memory creation phase.
