# Architecture in Web Dev - Monolithic vs Microservices
## Monolithic

- In the past, we used to build large projects where everything was bundled together.
- Imaging building an entire application where all the code-APIs, user interface, database connections, authentication, even notification services-resides in one massive project, with single code base.
- **Size and complexity limitation**: Monolithic applications become too large and complex to understand.
- **Slow startup**: The application's size can slow down startup time.
- **Full deployment required**: It's hard to grasp the full impact of changes leading to extensive manual testing.
- **Limited change understanding**: It's hard to grasp the full impact of changes, leading to extensive manual testing.
- **Difficult continuous deployment**: Implementing continuous deployment is challenging.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Different modules may have conflicting resource needs, making scaling difficulty.
- **Reliability Concerns**: Bugs in any module can crash the whole application, affecting availability.
- **Adoption of new technologies**: Making changes in frameworks or languages is expensive and time consuming since it affects the entire application.

## Microservices

- The idea is to split your application into a set of smaller, interconnected services instead of building a single monolithic application.
- Each services handles a specific job, like handling user accounts or managing payments.
- Inside each service, there's a mini-world of its own, with its own set of rules (business logic) and tools (adapters).
- Some services talk to each other in different ways, like using REST or messaging. Others might even have their own website.
- **Simpler Development**: Microservices break down complex applications into smaller, easier to handle services. This makes development faster and maintenance easier.
- **Independent Teams**: Each service can be developed independently by a team focused on that specific task.
- **Flexibility in technology**: Developers have freedome to choose the best technologies for each service, without being tied to choices made at the project's start.
- **Continous Deployment**: Microservices allow for independent deployment, enabling continous deployment for complex applications.
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently, ensuring efficient resource usage.
- **Separation of Concerns**: With each task having its own project, the architecture stays organized and manageable.
- **Single Responsibility**: Every service has its own job, following the principle of single responsibility. This ensures focused and efficient development.

### Why Microservices:
- Breaking things down into microservices helps us work faster and smarter. We can update or replace each piece without causing a fuss. It's like having a well-oiled machine where each part does it job perfectly.

### How services interact with each other in microservices?
 - UI microservice is written in React, which handles the user interface.
 - **Communication Channels:** These services interact with each other through various communication channels. For instance, the UI microservice might need data from the backend microservice, which in turn might need to access the database.
 - **Ports and Domain Mapping:** Each microservice runs on its specific port. This means that different services can be deployed independently, with each one assigned to a different port. All these ports are then mapped to a domain name, providing a unified access point for the entire application.

## Connecting to the external world
- There are two approaches to fetch and render the data:
  1. **Load and Render**: We can make the API call as soon as the app loads, fetch the data and render it.
  2. **Render first fetch later**: We can quickly render the UI when the page loads, we could show the structure of the web page, then make the API call. Once we get the data, we re-render the application to display the updated information.
- In react, second approach seems good approach as it enhances user experience by rendering the UI swiftly and then seamlessly updating it once we receive the data from the API call.

## Fetch API:
- The Fetch API provides a JS interfae for making HTTP request and processing the responses.
- Fetch is promise based and is integrated with features of the modern web such as service workers and CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
- With the Fetch API, you make a request by calling fetch(), which is available as a global function in both window and worker contexts.
- You pass it a Request object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request.
- It returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing the server's response.
- We can check the request status and extract the body of the response in various formats, including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.
```
const getData = async () => {
 const url = "<API_URL>";
 try {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (!response.ok) {
   throw new Error("Response Error");
  }
  const json = await response.json();
  console.log(json);
 } catch(error) {
  console.error(error.message);
 }
}
```
