# Routing in React
## SPA (Single page application)
- SPA stands for Single Page Application. It's a type of web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page rather than loading entire new pages from the server.
- In other words, a single HTML page is loaded initially, and then the content is updated dynamically as the user interacts with the application, typically through JavaScript.

**Characteristics of SPA:**
- **Dynamic Updates** - In SPAs, content is loaded and updated without requiring a full page reload. This is achieved using JavaScript and client-side routing.
- **Smooth User Experience** - SPAs can provide a smoother and more responsive user experience because they can update parts of the page without the entire page needing to be refreshed.
- **Faster Initial Load** - While the initial load of an SPA might take longer as it downloads more JavaScript and assets, subsequent interactions with the application can be faster because only data is exchanged with the server and not entire HTML pages.
- **Client-Side Routing** - SPAs often use client-side routing to simulate traditional page navigation while staying on the same HTML page. This is typically achieved using libraries like React Router or Vue Router.
- **API-Centric** - SPAs are often designed to be more API-centric, where the client communicates with a backend API to fetch and send data, usually in JSON format. This allows for decoupling the front end and back end.
- **State Management** - SPAs often use state management libraries (e.g., Redux for React or Vuex for Vue) to manage the application's state and data flow.

Popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue are commonly used to build SPAs. They offer tools and patterns to create efficient and maintainable single-page application.

## Client Side routing - Server Side routing
Client-side routing and server-side routing are two different approaches to handling routing and navigation in web applications. They have distinct characteristics and are often used for different purposes. Here's an overview of the key differences between them:

- `Client-Side Routing`: **Handling on the Client** - In client-side routing, routing and navigation are managed on the client side, typically within the web browser. JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React Router (for React applications) or Vue Router (for Vue.js applications), are commonly used to implement client-side routing.

**Faster Transitions** - Client-side routing allows for faster page transitions since it doesn't require the server to send a new HTML page for each route change. Instead, it updates the DOM and URL dynamically without full page reloads.

**Single-Page Application (SPA)** - Client-side routing is often associated with single-page applications (SPAs), where the initial HTML page is loaded, and subsequent page changes are made by updating the content using JavaScript.

**SEO Challenges** - SPAs can face challenges with search engine optimization (SEO) because search engine crawlers may not fully index the content that relies heavily on client-side rendering. Special techniques like server-side rendering (SSR) or pre-rendering can be used to address this issue.

**Route Management** - Routing configuration is typically defined in code and managed on the client side, allowing for dynamic and flexible route handling.

- `Server-Side Routing`: **Handling on the Server** - Server-side routing manages routing and navigation on the server. When a user requests a different URL, the server generates and sends a new HTML page for that route.

**Slower Transitions** - Server-side routing tends to be slower in terms of page transitions compared to client-side routing, as it involves full page reloads.

**Traditional Websites** - Server-side routing is commonly used for traditional multi-page websites where each page is a separate HTML document generated by the server.

**SEO-Friendly** - Server-side routing is inherently more SEO-friendly, as each page is a separate HTML document that can be easily crawled and indexed by search engines.

**Route Configuration** - Routing configuration in server-side routing is typically managed on the server, and URLs directly correspond to individual HTML files or routes.


## React Routing: (React router dom)
- React Router enables "client side routing".
- React router is an external package that will helps to add client side routing in our application.

### Installation:
`npm install react-router-dom`

### Router configuration in application:
#### Step 1: Adding a Router
- First thing to do is create a Browser Router and configure our first route. This will enable client side routing for our web app.
- The index.jsx file is the entry point. Open it up and we'll put React Router on the page.
```
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <div>Hello world</div>,
  },
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ReactProvider router={router}/>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
