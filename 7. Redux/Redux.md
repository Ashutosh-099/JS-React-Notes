- Redux is an open JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state.
- It not only React library, it is populary used with React, but it can used for other frameworks as well.
- Features of Redux is: `Predictable`, `Centralized`, `Debuggable` and `Flexible`.
- There are some libraries from Redux Team: `React-Redux` and `Redux Toolkit`.

## Redux Toolkit

- It was originally create to help address three common concerns about Redux:
  1. Configuiting a redux store is too complicated.
  2. Need to add lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful.
  3. Redux requires too much boilerplate code.
